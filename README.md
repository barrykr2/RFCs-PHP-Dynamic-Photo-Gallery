# RFCs-PHP-Dynamic-Photo-Gallery
This PHP code is used to find all images and sub folders in a folder called "gallery" and display them using "SimpleLightbox v2.10.3 by Andre Rinas https://simplelightbox.com/".

A working example can be seen at https://redfoxcottage.net/images/Timberlea/

It is a work in progress and I'm open to comments and criticism.  While I've been coding forever, I'm now retired and decided to expand my knowledge (just for fun) and am new to WEB and PHP development (I'm primarily a backend server developer).
